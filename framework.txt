St-Pierre��s research focuses on optical methods for imaging brain activity with exquisite spatiotemporal resolution. These methods create a more complete and accurate image of how neuronal networks communicate �C how they send signals and the paths those signals take �C which ultimately guides our behavior. This in turn helps researchers understand what is happening in the brain when those processes are not working correctly.
